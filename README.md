# ISDP-Cosman,Dallas
# End of program project for IT: Programmer Analyst.
# This is a project done individually, and involves improving a outdated inventory/warehouse management system for a made up company called Bullsey Sporting Goods.
# The system is built from nothing as the companies previous system is too outdated and needs a completely new system to be developed.
# I chose to do my project in C#, and the database is MySQL.
